After repairing a Generator for at least 3 seconds, it will be highlighted to you with a yellow Aura. The Generator stays highlighted until it is fully repairing, or you repair a new Generator, or enter a Locker. Entering any Locker will trigger a Loud Noise indicator for the Killer at the highlighted Generator's location. Red Herring can only be triggered once every 100/80/60 seconds.",
